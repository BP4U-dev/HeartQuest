If you use the Unity player or a Unity-based companion app, enable Unity Analytics in the Unity Editor:

1. Window > Package Manager > install/enable Unity Analytics (or UGS Analytics).
2. Services > Analytics: link your project and enable data collection.
3. Use `AnalyticsService.Instance.CustomData("eventName", dataDict);` in C#.
